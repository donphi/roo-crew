# Roo Crew: Custom AI Agent Orchestration & Project Milestone Framework for RooCode

This repository works with the RooCode VS Code extension to create and orchestrate specialized AI agent teams tailored to your specific project requirements. It enables you to define, configure, and deploy custom agents with precise orchestration based on your project configuration, while also generating detailed step-by-step project milestones for each individual agent to achieve your project goals.

The framework creates a structured approach to AI-assisted development by combining:
1. **Custom Agent Generation**: Create specialized AI agents with specific roles and expertise
2. **Orchestrated Workflows**: Define how agents collaborate and hand off tasks
3. **Detailed Milestones**: Generate comprehensive step-by-step plans for project implementation
4. **Containerized Development**: Ensure consistent environments through Docker-first principles

## Overview

The Roo Crew framework integrates with RooCode VS Code extension to provide a comprehensive project development system with two main components that work in sequence:

1. **Agent Team Generation**: Using the `🧠 Visionary Recruiter` to create a specialized team of AI agents based on your project requirements, with each agent having specific expertise, responsibilities, and boundaries.

   The Visionary Recruiter helps you define your technology stack across multiple categories:
   - **Project Overview**: Project type, domain, and high-level requirements
   - **Frontend Technologies**: Framework, UI design system, state management, data visualization
   - **Backend Technologies**: Primary language, framework, API architecture
   - **Database & Storage**: Primary database, vector database, caching layer
   - **AI/ML Components**: LLM provider, embedding model, ML framework
   - **DevOps & Infrastructure**: Containerization, CI/CD pipeline, deployment target
   - **Quality Assurance**: Testing frameworks, code quality tools, performance testing
   - **Monitoring & Observability**: Logging, metrics & tracing

2. **YAML Workflow Documentation**: Using the `📋 YAML Architect` to create detailed step-by-step workflow documentation that assigns tasks to the specific agents created in the first phase.

   The YAML Architect creates comprehensive workflow documentation across five key phases:
   - **Phase 1: Project Initialization** - Environment setup, repository initialization, architecture scaffolding
   - **Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Development** - Database schema, authentication, API structure, component libraries
   - **Phase 3: Feature Development** - Feature implementation, TDD workflow, documentation, code review
   - **Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance** - Unit, integration, E2E, performance, and security testing
   - **Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring** - CI/CD pipeline, environments, monitoring, backup procedures

This two-phase approach ensures that the YAML workflow documentation is tailored to your specific agent team, with each task assigned to the most appropriate specialized agent based on their expertise and responsibilities. The result is a highly structured, milestone-driven development process where each agent knows exactly what to do, when to do it, and how it fits into the overall project goals.
By leveraging the RooCode VS Code extension with this framework, you can:
- Create custom agent teams with specialized expertise for your specific technology stack
- Generate detailed project plans with clear milestones and responsibilities
- Ensure consistent development practices through containerization and standardized workflows
- Maintain high code quality through test-driven development and comprehensive documentation
- Orchestrate complex development tasks across multiple specialized agents
This two-phase approach ensures that the YAML workflow documentation is tailored to your specific agent team, with each task assigned to the most appropriate specialized agent based on their expertise and responsibilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern LLM with agent capabilities (recommended: **Gemini 2.5** or **Claude 3.7**)
- Basic understanding of software development concepts
- A clear idea of your project requirements

## Phase 1: Agent Team Generation

This phase focuses on creating your specialized team of AI agents based on your project requirements.

### Steps:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/donphi/roo-crew.git
   cd roo-crew
   ```

2. **Customize the recruitment prompt**:
   - Open `prompt_recruitment.md` in your editor
   - Follow the instructions to select your technology stack, architectural patterns, and team structure
   - Customize the sections to match your project's specific requirements

3. **Generate your agent team**:
   - Use the 🧠 **Visionary Recruiter** mode to process your recruitment prompt
   - Run the following command in your LLM interface:
   ```
   Please analyze the prompt_recruitment.md file and generate a complete agent team definition based on the specified requirements.
   ```

4. **Implement the generated team**:
   - Follow the instructions provided by the Visionary Recruiter
   - Create the necessary agent definition files in the `.roomodes` file
   - Set up the required rules and protocols in the `.roo/rules/` directory

## Phase 2: YAML Workflow Documentation

After your agent team is created, this phase focuses on generating detailed workflow documentation that assigns tasks to your specialized agents.

### Steps:

1. **Customize the YAML workflow prompt**:
   - Open `prompt_yaml_workflow.md` in your editor
   - Ensure it references your project's specific requirements and technology stack
   - Make sure the Docker-First Principle and Command Execution sections are properly configured

2. **Generate YAML workflow documentation**:
   - Use the 📋 **YAML Architect** mode to create comprehensive workflow documentation
   - Run the following command in your LLM interface:
   ```
   Please analyze the prompt_yaml_workflow.md file and generate complete YAML workflow documentation for the project, assigning tasks to the specialized agents created in Phase 1.
   ```

3. **Review and implement the workflows**:
   - The YAML Architect will create detailed YAML files in the `config/` directory
   - Each file will document a specific phase of the project with tasks assigned to your specialized agents
   - These workflows serve as the blueprint for implementing your project

## Using the Agent Team and Workflows

Once your agent team and workflow documentation are set up, you can:

1. **Assign tasks to specific agents** based on their expertise as defined in the YAML workflows
2. **Coordinate complex workflows** through the 🚀 Project Orchestrator
3. **Maintain consistent code quality** through the established rules and protocols
4. **Scale your team** by adding new specialized agents as needed

The YAML workflow documentation provides a detailed roadmap for your project, with each task assigned to the specific agent from your team who is best suited to handle it.

## Repository Structure

- `prompt_recruitment.md`: The main configuration file for defining your project requirements
- `prompt_yaml_workflow.md`: Configuration for generating YAML workflow documentation
- `.roomodes`: Defines the available agent modes and their capabilities
- `.roo/rules/`: Contains global rules that apply to all agents
- `.roo/rules-{agent-slug}/`: Contains specific rules for each agent type
- `config/`: Contains YAML workflow documentation files that assign tasks to your agents

## Required Changes to Prompt Files

### Changes to `prompt_yaml_workflow.md`

Add the following to the Docker-First Principle section (section 2.3, point 4):

```markdown
4. **Docker-First Principle**: You MUST assume that all development occurs within Docker containers. No direct installation of tools on the host system is permitted. All environment setup must be containerized. CRITICAL: ALL commands (npm, yarn, tests, builds, etc.) MUST be executed within Docker containers. Commands should be prefixed with appropriate Docker or Docker Compose commands (e.g., `docker-compose exec`, `docker run`). The development container should be built at the beginning of the project in development mode, used throughout the development process, and only at the end should production containers be created.
```

Add a new point after Git Integration (section 2.3, point 6):

```markdown
6. **Command Execution**: Before executing any workflow, the YAML Architect MUST read and understand all YAML configuration files in the config/ directory to ensure adherence to established patterns and avoid inconsistencies.
```

### Changes to `prompt_recruitment.md`

Ensure the Containerization section (section 1.6) includes Docker and Docker Compose as selected options, and that the Deployment Pipeline section (section 3.4) emphasizes containerization:

```markdown
**Containerization:** All components must be containerized using Docker or equivalent technology <!-- Consistent environments -->
```

## Agent Modes to Use

1. **🧠 Visionary Recruiter**: Use this mode first to create your agent team based on the `prompt_recruitment.md` file. This agent will design a comprehensive team structure tailored to your project's specific technology stack and requirements.

2. **📋 YAML Architect**: Use this mode after your agent team is defined to create detailed YAML workflow documentation based on the `prompt_yaml_workflow.md` file. This agent will produce comprehensive step-by-step workflow files that assign tasks to the specialized agents created by the Visionary Recruiter.

3. **🚀 Project Orchestrator**: Once your team and workflows are defined, use this mode to coordinate tasks and delegate work to specialized agents according to the YAML workflow documentation.

## Example Workflow Files

The `config/` directory contains example YAML workflow files that demonstrate the expected structure and level of detail:

1. `example_01_project_initialization.yaml`: Project setup, repository initialization, and Docker environment configuration
2. `example_02_core_infrastructure.yaml`: Database schema, authentication system, UI component library, and API layer
3. `example_03_feature_development.yaml`: Dashboard layout, visualizations, data processing, and custom features
4. `example_04_testing_quality_assurance.yaml`: Unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, performance testing, and security testing
5. `example_05_deployment_monitoring.yaml`: CI/CD pipeline, environment setup, monitoring, logging, and backup procedures

These files provide a real-world example with detailed steps that demonstrate the level of precision expected from the YAML Architect. Each step is assigned to a specific agent role from the team created by the Visionary Recruiter, ensuring that tasks are handled by the most appropriate specialized agent.

**Workflow Summary**: The five phases create a comprehensive development lifecycle that guides your project from inception to production:

1. **Project Initialization**: Establishes the foundation with proper environment setup, repository structure, and centralized configuration, ensuring all subsequent development follows consistent patterns.

2. **Core Infrastructure**: Builds the essential backend and frontend infrastructure components that will support all features, focusing on database design, authentication, API structure, and reusable components.

3. **Feature Development**: Implements specific features using test-driven development, with clear documentation and code review processes to maintain quality throughout the development cycle.

4. **Testing & Quality Assurance**: Ensures comprehensive testing at all levels (unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, security) to verify the application meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

5. **Deployment & Monitoring**: Establishes automated deployment pipelines, configures production environments, and implements monitoring and backup systems to ensure reliable operation and quick response to issues.

This structured approach ensures that your project progresses methodically through well-defined stages, with clear responsibilities for each specialized agent at every step of the process.

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific in your technology selections** - The more precise you are about your tech stack, the better tailored your agent team will be.

2. **Follow the TDD workflow** - The agents are designed to work in a test-driven development environment.

3. **Maintain centralized configuration** - All configuration should be managed through a single source of truth.

4. **Document everything** - Ensure comprehensive documentation is maintained throughout the project lifecycle.

5. **Use the confirmation gate** - Always confirm before pushing changes to the repository.

6. **Enforce containerization** - All development and testing should occur within Docker containers to ensure consistency.

## LLM Recommendations
